## 🏕️ Dataset
Briefly introduce your experimental data (including what kind of data it is, how it was obtained, and what kind of preprocessing was carried out).  简要介绍一下你的实验数据（包括是什么数据，如何获得，以及进行了何种预处理）

We assume the data folder (`datasets`) has the following structure: 

```
# Provide the organization structure of the dataset.
such as:
datasets
├── <dataset_name> 
│ └── img
│   └── ...
│ └── label
│   └── ...
│ └── train
│   └── train.txt
│ └── val
│   └── val.txt
│ └── test
│   └── test.txt
│ └── metrics
```

## 🚀 Quick Start 🔥🔥🔥

### 🦄 Pretrained Models

If a pre-trained model is used, specify which model is used and how to obtain the pre-trained weights.如果使用了预训练模型，请指明使用了哪种模型以及如何获取预训练权重。 

## 🛠️ Environment

Training and evaluation environment:  Python XX,  PyTorch XX,  CUDA XX.  Run the following command to install required packages.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```



## 🔨Training 

Here explains how to train your model and what the input and output of the training are 这里说明如何训练你的模型，以及训练的输入输出

```
#Please provide the commands on how to train the your model on your data.
```

 ⚠️ Note: Emphasize some points that need to be noted.  强调需要注意的点。



## 🏗️ Evaluation

Here explains how to evaluate the performance of your model, including which file the test code is in and how to conduct the test (what the input and output of the test code are). 这里将说明如何评估你的模型的性能，包括测试代码所在的文件，以及如何进行测试（测试代码的输入和输出分别是什么）。

```
#Please provide the commands on how to evaluate the performance of your model.
```

 ⚠️ Note: Emphasize some points that need to be noted. 强调需要注意的点。
